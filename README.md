**Simulated Cricket scoreboard on 8051 microprocessor as a part of EE337 course project**
> The LCD should will display the current score and the number of overs bowled on the first line.</br>
`The format should be Runs/Wickets (Overs.Balls). For example, 45/3 (15.2) means that 45 runs have been scored in 15 overs and 2 balls for the loss of 3 wickets`

>The LCD should show the events of the current over on the second line in thefollowing format</br>
``• The event which occurred on a ball is denoted by a single character``</br>
`• A dot ball is denoted by a period symbol (also called the fullstop symbol)`</br>
`• Runs scored on a ball are denoted by the single digit number.`</br>
`• If a wicket falls in a ball, it is denoted by the W character.`</br>
`• A wide ball is denoted by the E character`</br>
`•  A no-ball is denoted by the N character`</br>

>• At the start of a game, the first line will show 0/0 (0.0).</br>
>•  The scorer will press a series of keys which will move the game forward and change the scoreboard state.</br>

> Exceptions:</br>
